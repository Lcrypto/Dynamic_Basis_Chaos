# Dynamic_Basis_Chaos

Exploration of methods for analyzing chaotic dynamics by projecting onto local linear subspaces. Over a short enough time scale, even chaotic systems admit low-rank linear representations through Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This code demos a few techniques for modeling dynamics in this evolving-basis framework.

Some plots use the boundedline package available here: https://github.com/kakearney/boundedline-pkg
